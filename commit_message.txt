fix: Remove file size limit and update billing error handling

- Remove 500-item limit check for JSON files as rate limit was caused by billing issues
- Restore normal API request parameters (batch size: 10, delay: 0.1s)
- Update error messages to indicate billing account check
- Add comprehensive billing troubleshooting guide (BILLING_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Update README with billing problem references and new documentation links
- Add alternative translation engine support (Claude API)

The "User Rate Limit Exceeded" error was caused by Google Cloud billing account 
issues, not actual rate limits. This commit removes unnecessary restrictions and 
provides better guidance for resolving billing-related problems.
