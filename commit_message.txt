fix: Remove file size limit and update billing error handling

- Remove 500-item limit check for JSON files as rate limit was caused by billing issues
- Restore normal API request parameters (batch size: 10, delay: 0.1s)
- Update error messages to indicate billing account check
- Add comprehensive billing troubleshooting guide (BILLING_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Update README with billing problem references and new documentation links
- Add alternative translation engine support (Claude API)

The "User Rate Limit Exceeded" error was caused by Google Cloud billing account 
issues, not actual rate limits. This commit removes unnecessary restrictions and 
provides better guidance for resolving billing-related problems.

New files:
- BILLING_TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Guide for resolving Google Cloud billing issues
- CLAUDE_API_SETUP.md: Instructions for using Claude API as alternative
- CREATE_NEW_PROJECT.md: Guide for creating new Google Cloud project
- translate_claude.py: Claude API translation implementation
- check_api_status.py: Tool to monitor API recovery status

Modified files:
- translate.py: Removed file size limits, updated error handling
- config.py: Added translation engine configuration
- README.md: Updated with new troubleshooting information 

feat: Add detailed real-time translation progress tracking

- Implement item-level progress tracking for translations
- Add progress callback functionality to all translation functions
- Display current translating key/value pair with item count (e.g., "pt: 正在翻译: 新邮箱 (1/660)")
- Calculate accurate progress percentages for multi-language translations
- Show detailed progress information via Socket.IO:
  - Overall progress percentage
  - Current language being translated
  - Specific key being translated
  - Items completed vs total items
- Update README to document enhanced progress features

The translation process now provides granular feedback, especially useful for 
large files. Users can see exactly which item is being translated and track 
the progress of each language translation in real-time.

Modified files:
- translate.py: Added progress_callback parameter to translation functions
- app.py: Implemented progress callback with detailed status messages
- README.md: Updated documentation to reflect new progress tracking features

This enhancement significantly improves user experience by providing transparency
into the translation process, particularly beneficial for large JSON/JS files
with hundreds of key-value pairs. 

fix: Resolve translation completion freeze and optimize performance

## Bug Fixes
- Fix BrokenPipeError causing page freeze after translation completion
- Resolve Socket.IO connection issues with form submission
- Fix progress bar not resetting immediately on page reload

## Performance Improvements  
- Remove unnecessary 1-second delays in batch processing
- Save ~66 seconds for 660-item translations
- Optimize request flow with AJAX submission

## User Experience Enhancements
- Convert form submission to AJAX for smoother experience
- Add "Translating..." state with spinner icon on submit button
- Auto-redirect to success page after completion
- Remove redundant "Refresh Page" button from success page
- Ensure progress bar resets properly on page load

## Technical Changes
- Replace traditional form POST with Fetch API
- Add `/success` route for GET requests
- Send completion signal with redirect URL via Socket.IO
- Improve error handling for network failures
- Add file existence check before deletion

This update significantly improves the translation workflow by eliminating
the completion freeze issue and reducing translation time by removing
unnecessary delays. The AJAX-based submission provides a more modern and
reliable user experience.

Modified files:
- app.py: Add success route, implement AJAX handling, fix completion flow
- templates/upload.html: Convert to AJAX submission, handle completion signal
- templates/success.html: Remove refresh button
- translate.py: Comment out batch processing delays
- README.md: Update documentation with new features
- CHANGELOG.md: Add version 1.3.0 release notes
